DAWSON EXTRACTOR - STOP/RESUME INSTRUCTIONS
============================================

HOW DEDUPLICATION WORKS
-----------------------
On startup, the extractor scans all existing PDFs in the downloads/ directory,
extracts document IDs (UUIDs) from filenames, and skips any already-downloaded
documents. This means you can safely stop and restart at any time.


STOPPING THE EXTRACTOR
----------------------
Find the process ID:
  ps aux | grep dawson_extractor

Stop it gracefully:
  kill -INT <PID>


RESUMING LATER
--------------
Just run the same command again:
  cd /home/taimur/Projects/dawson_extractor
  ./venv/bin/python dawson_extractor.py

It will print "Found X existing documents..." and only download new ones.


CLEANUP: FIX INCOMPLETE DOWNLOADS
---------------------------------
If the process was interrupted mid-download, you may have partial PDFs without
their companion .json metadata files. Run this to find and remove them:

  cd /home/taimur/Projects/dawson_extractor/downloads
  find . -name "*.pdf" | while read pdf; do
    json="${pdf%.pdf}.json"
    if [ ! -f "$json" ]; then
      echo "Removing orphan: $pdf"
      rm "$pdf"
    fi
  done

The extractor will re-download those files on the next run.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Edit config.json to change:
  - num_orders: target number of documents to download
  - document_types: which document types to fetch
  - rate_limit_delay: seconds between API requests (default 0.5)
